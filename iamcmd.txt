[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       AWS  Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can
       use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS  account.  This
       guide  provides  descriptions of IAM actions that you can call program-
       matically. For general information about  IAM,  see  [4mAWS[24m  [4mIdentity[24m  [4mand[0m
       [4mAccess[24m [4mManagement[24m [4m(IAM)[24m . For the user guide for IAM, see [4mUsing[24m [4mIAM[24m .

       [1mNOTE:[0m
          AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
          ious programming languages and platforms  (Java,  Ruby,  .NET,  iOS,
          Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create program-
          matic access to IAM and AWS. For example,  the  SDKs  take  care  of
          tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), manag-
          ing errors, and retrying  requests  automatically.  For  information
          about  the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
          the [4mTools[24m [4mfor[24m [4mAmazon[24m [4mWeb[24m [4mServices[24m page.

       We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic  API  calls
       to  IAM.  However,  you  can  also use the IAM Query API to make direct
       calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the  IAM  Query  API,
       see  [4mMaking[24m [4mQuery[24m [4mRequests[24m in the [4mUsing[24m [4mIAM[24m guide. IAM supports GET and
       POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to
       use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are
       subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that
       require larger sizes, use a POST request.
          [1mSigning Requests[0m

       Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key.
       We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account  access  key
       ID  and  secret  access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the
       access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use  the
       AWS  Security  Token Service to generate temporary security credentials
       and use those to sign requests.

       To sign requests, we recommend that you use [4mSignature[24m [4mVersion[24m  [4m4[24m  .  If
       you  have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do
       not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some  opera-
       tions now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations
       that require version 4 indicate this requirement.
